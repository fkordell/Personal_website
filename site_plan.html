      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Looking to find quality information/training/gear and hookups for all of your disc golfing needs? You have come to the right place! 
        The worst feeling in the world is when you are trying to find some quality content but even the extensive web searches cause you to turn up empty handed.
        Our website has resources you won't be dissapointed in such as videos and tutorials from professionals that can help  disc golfers from any skill level from beginners looking to try something new to Pros and everything in between.
        We also provide all kinds of disc golfing merchandise to get you started or to even add to your already existing collection. We also know how frustrating it can be to not even know where to go to find accurate up to date locations 
        and courses to play on and even live events going on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Disc golfing is a really fun sport, trust us we know! We want to take the pressures of finding the resources you need off of your shoulders by providing you with all of this great content. It is a growing sport though and so finding
        what you need can be a hassle and a half. Here at Disc Like a Pro we are here to serve everyone and want to be able to allow for even the most beginners to become what they want to be.

      <h3>Take a tip from some pros!</h3>
      <p>
        Becoming good at anything takes time and practice but maybe we can help you on your journey to upping your game so that even with little experience you'll be looking like you've been doing this for forever.
        We understand that people are going to be on different levels and so we have gathered together some resources as far as tips and tutorials from professionals that people of any skill level can access and use as a template to improve your own game.
      </p>
      <p>
        More important than having videos and tutorials where you are watching what others are doing, is being able to get out there and put some of those things into practice. Practical application will help you to get comfortable and to get a feel for what 
        you are doing and what things you can start implementing. Here you can find great advice and examples of things you can try from experienced pros but you can also find locations of courses and events happening in your home regions.

      <h3>Look The Part</h3>
      <p>
        Another important aspect to getting started and even improving in your skills and abilities is having the proper gear to get the job done right. We are all for saving money and doing things you love for cheaper but if you are going to do something right
        and you are going to do it well, having really good equipment at an affordable price is key to your success. As you develop your talents and abilities you will come to realize that some methods and techniques cannot be done any better without upgrading and
        obtaining higher quality equipment and gear.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Pro Golfers we want to provide you with merchandise that you'll love and that will help you to perform at your best at the most affordable prices. Our goal is not only to help you on your journey to learning and developing your skill set from beginner to expert.
